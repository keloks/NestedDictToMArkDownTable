# NestedDictToMArkDownTable
A function written in python that converts a nested dictionary to a string simulating the markdown format of tables.

It works for nested dictionaries for which the inner dicts have the same labels. For example:

mountainsDic = {'Everest' : {'altitude': 8848, 'snow': 1, 'climbing': 1}, 'Monte Perdido': {'altitude' : 3355, 'snow' : 1, 'climbing': 0}}

Inside every mountain we have the same labels: 'altitude', 'snow' and 'cimbling'.

You may need to modify it depending on the number of labels of the dictionary.

Feel free to use it and modify it however you want ;D
